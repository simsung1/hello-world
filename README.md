# hello-world
This is my hello-world tutorial follow-through.

Since this project is my **first ever** official GitHub interaction, I'm so excited to start becoming more proficient with this tool.
There are a couple things I would like to practice in this project:
1. Practicing Markdown Syntax
2. Getting through the basics of GitHub and learning GitBash/terminal
3. Practice git pull, push, commit, etc. that my *instructor* has assigned
